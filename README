HOW TO RUN
----------

** To run the NER program

1) Place the files you want to annotate in the 'textfiles' sub-folder

2) Change the following BASEPATH to your local configuration and export:

BASEPATH="/home/rdb20/swat-4-med-safety/u-of-pitt-SPL-drug-NER" 

3) Configure the 'dictionary_path' variable in etc/file_properties.xml so the the path to the WordNet dictionary resolves correctly

4) Configure the BASEPATH and PIPATH path assignments in src/groovy/util/PItoXML.groovy

5) export this variable

CLASSPATH=$BASEPATH/lib/xml-apis-1.4.01.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-iri-0.9.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/httpcore-4.1.3.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/extjwnl-1.6.4.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/commons-codec-1.5.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-arq-2.9.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/log4j-1.2.16.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/concurrentlinkedhashmap-lru-1.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-tdb-0.9.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/httpclient-4.1.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/extjwnl-utilities-1.6.4.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-core-2.7.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.17.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/xercesImpl-2.10.0.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/http-builder-0.5.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jackson-core-2.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jackson-databind-2.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jackson-annotations-2.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/target/classes/:


5) Run

$ groovy -cp $CLASSPATH src/groovy/util/PItoXML.groovy

6) Output will be written to 'processed-output' -- 


** Test run of the Annotator

1) Set the BASEPATH and CLASSPATH as above

2) compile using 'ant compile'

3) cd target/classes

4) java -cp $CLASSPATH  ncbo/AnnotatorClient

There is a default string that will be sent to the annotator for
processing. You should see results from MESH and RXNORM.

------------------------------------------------------------
Validation procedure
------------------------------------------------------------

1) remove any text files from the folder 'textfiles'

2) copy all sections located in 'sample-package-insert-statements' to the 'textfiles' folder

3) run the NER program. This will produce output XML files in the 'processed-output' folder

4) make a temporary folder for analysis e.g, /tmp/ner-performance-analysis-09152014/

5) now run the following series of commands from within the ZSH shell

$ cd textfiles

$ for i in *.txt
echo $i && python ../src/python/calculate-metrics-for-a-single-note.py -n ../processed-output/$i-PROCESSED.xml -k ../pi-knowtator-xml/$i.knowtator.xml > <path to analysis folder>/$i-ner-performance.txt

5) Use these grep commands for getting lists of recall, precision, and F values that can then be copied into R vectors for summary statistics

grep -r "Recall:" ./
grep -r "F-measure:" ./
grep -r "precision:" ./


NOTE: when this analysis was ran on 9.15.2014 to detect changes in
performance due to migration to Bioportal v4, the following sections
had to be edited for the NER to complete:

- package-insert-section-20.txt
- package-insert-section-55.txt

In both cases, the string 'magnesium stearate" had to be removed from
the orignal text so the the NER program did not generate the following
exception:

java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 500 for URL: http://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/MESH/classes/http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2FMESH%2FC031183

xmllint --encode UTF-8 $i > $i-LINTED.xml

How to converts NER outputs to the format that feeds domeo loading program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) run section text parsing program at "analyses/ddi-table-parsing/scripts/retrieveSPLSquery.py"

Inputs: list of setIds at file "analyses/ddi-table-parsing/scripts/setIDs.txt"
Outputs: dailymed section text at folder "analyses/ddi-table-parsing/scripts/outfiles"
Copy txt files in outfiles folder to "u-of-pitt-SPL-drug-NER/textfiles/" as section label sources

(2) run NER program to get NER dataset in XML

(3) run converting script "convertNER_2_JSON_DOMEO.py" to get ner data set in json format that feeds domeo annotation pre-loading program

$ convertNER_2_JSON_DOMEO.py > NER-outputs.json

domeo loading program at "u-of-pitt-spl-ddi-v2.0/PK-DDI-NLP-pipeline/loadElasticSearch"
