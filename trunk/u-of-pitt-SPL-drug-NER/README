HOW TO RUN
----------

** To run the NER program

1) Place the files you want to annotate in the 'textfiles' sub-folder

2) Change the following BASEPATH to your local configuration and export:

BASEPATH="/home/boycerd/Dropbox/SemEval-2013-DDI-challenge/boyce-code/drug-NER" 

3) Configure the 'dictionary_path' variable in etc/file_properties.xml so the the path to the WordNet dictionary resolves correctly

4) Configure the following path assignments in src/groovy/util/PItoXML.groovy:

CLASSPATH=$BASEPATH/lib/xml-apis-1.4.01.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-iri-0.9.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/httpcore-4.1.3.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/extjwnl-1.6.4.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/commons-codec-1.5.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-arq-2.9.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/log4j-1.2.16.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/concurrentlinkedhashmap-lru-1.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-tdb-0.9.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/httpclient-4.1.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/extjwnl-utilities-1.6.4.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jena-core-2.7.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.17.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/xercesImpl-2.10.0.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/http-builder-0.5.2.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jackson-core-2.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jackson-databind-2.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/lib/jackson-annotations-2.1.1.jar:$BASEPATH/classes/:


5) Run

$ groovy -cp $CLASSPATH src/groovy/util/PItoXML.groovy

6) Output will be written to 'processed-output' -- 


** Test run of the Annotator

1) Set the BASEPATH and CLASSPATH as above

2) compile using 'ant compile'

3) cd target/classes

4) java -cp $CLASSPATH  ncbo/AnnotatorClient

There is a default string that will be sent to the annotator for
processing. You should see results from MESH and RXNORM.
